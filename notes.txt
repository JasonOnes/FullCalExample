More notes in files, specifically json.html

It appears that cells(days) are not currently selected by clicks. They are highlited (selected) by drag events however.

TODO:
    Need to figure out how to add events to events.json
    Using AJAX to pull data server side to get db info
    Use AJAX to GET/POST client side to spoontacular api
    Pop up menu as click event for each day, I think we can use the fc-past as a conditional to ignore days that have passed,
    perhaps color blocking them neutral
